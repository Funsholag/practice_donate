            <span class="caption">After working in a dirty studio with no ventilation and a boss who cared little for her employees, I was beginning to question what I was doing with my life. One day, while vacuuming up rat poop I realized I had hit a low point and decided it was time to make a change. I thought there must be more to life to than cleaning up after rats for a menial salary, so that’s when I went home and frantically searched for other options. I was complaining to my boyfriend about what to do and he said I really think you would like coding you should give it a try. I found the New York Code and Design Academy online and saw that they had a class coming up in March, “this is the answer I thought!” and immediately applied. The next day I put in my two weeks noticed and said goodbye to the rats for good. Donate now help me make my dream of never having to clean up after rats and becoming a coder come true!</span>
